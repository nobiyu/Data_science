# Exploratory Data Analysis of Covid-19 Data of Indian States #

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Covid-19 data of Indian states. The data is sourced from the Kaggle. The data contains data about active cases, deaths, recoveries for each state and union territory of India from January 2020 to present.

The goal of this project is to gain insights and understand the Covid-19 situation in different states of India by analyzing the data using various statistical techniques and visualizations. The project is divided into several sections, including:

Data Collection and Cleaning: The data is downloaded from the official website and cleaned to remove any missing or duplicate values. The data is then transformed to make it suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: In this section, the data is analyzed using various statistical techniques such as summary statistics, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing. Visualizations such as line graphs, scatter plots, heatmaps, and choropleth maps are also used to gain insights into the data.

Key Findings and Insights: The key findings and insights from the analysis are presented in this section. The findings are presented in an easy-to-understand format using charts and graphs.

Conclusion and Future Work: The project concludes with a summary of the key findings and insights. The future work that can be done to extend this project is also discussed.
